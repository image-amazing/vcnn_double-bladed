# VCNN - Double-Bladed Sword
Vectorized implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in <b>Matlab</b> for both visual recognition and image processing. It's a unified framework for both high level and low level computer vision tasks.

## How to use it
You can <b>directly</b> try the demos without referring to any materials in the [project website](http://vcnn.deeplearning.cc). <br>
1. For MNIST, you can launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/MNIST/mnist_test_demo.m) to use a pre-trained model. For training, just launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/MNIST/mnist_train_demo.m). You will get sensible results within seconds.<br>
2. For image denoise, launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/image_denoise/denoise_test_demo.m) to see the denoise result by pre-train models. For training, you need to generate the data yourself since the data used in the training is large. Please do the following steps to generate data: a) download MIT saliency dataset from [here](http://saliency.mit.edu/BenchmarkIMAGES.zip) and put all the image files [here](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/tree/master/data/denoise/mit_saliency); b) launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/image_denoise/gen_data/gen_training_data.m) to generate training data; c) launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/image_denoise/gen_data/gen_val_data.m) to generate validation data; d) launch [this script](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/image_denoise/denoise_train_demo.m) to start the training.<br>

Please visit the [project website](http://vcnn.deeplearning.cc) for all documents, examples and videos.

## Hardware/software requirements
1. Matlab 2014b or later, CUDA 6.0 or later (currently tested in Windows 7)<br>
2. A Nvidia GPU with 2GB GPU memory or above (if you would like to run on GPU). You can also train a new model without a GPU by specifying "config.compute_device = 'CPU';" in the config file (e.g. [mnist_configure.m](https://github.com/vcnn/vcnn_double-bladed/blob/master/applications/MNIST/mnist_configure.m)). <br>
